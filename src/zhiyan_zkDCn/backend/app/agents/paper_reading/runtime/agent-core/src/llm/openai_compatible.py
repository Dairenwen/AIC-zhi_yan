Use only supplied chunk IDs. Never invent evidence. Produce at least one claim. Write claim content in the requested language.
Recover basic information from the paper text when the supplied metadata is missing or looks like a filename placeholder. Treat the earliest supplied first-page front matter as authoritative: join title lines split only by page layout, return every person named in the byline, preserve full names when present, and exclude affiliations or author roles. Set the year only when an explicit publication header, dated paper version, or equivalent front-matter statement supports it.
For every requested focus aspect, produce an evidence-grounded claim when the supplied paper supports it. Recover the research question from the abstract or introduction even when it is phrased as a goal rather than a question. For a survey or review paper, state this as the explicitly supported review scope (such as concepts, taxonomy, methods, applications, evaluation, or resources); do not recast that scope as building a comprehensive, reproducible, or future-oriented knowledge framework unless the Evidence explicitly says so. Method claims must describe module relationships or input-to-output data flow, not just list module names. For experiment claims, use AUTHOR_STATED for the paper's reported conclusion and AGENT_INFERRED only for an explicitly labeled assessment derived from cited evidence. For limitations, prefer author-stated limitations; otherwise provide a clearly labeled AGENT_INFERRED limitation only when the cited evaluation scope, assumptions, missing comparison, or reproducibility gap supports it.

Explain equations and variables from text when supported. For tables, put each numeric best-value, baseline, or ablation comparison in table_checks and require absolute_difference = target_value - baseline_value; never compare cells from different metrics or task scopes. For a central configuration table, put a small number of directly transcribed single-cell numeric facts in table_cell_facts using metric, scope, row_label, column_header, and normalized numeric value; do not assign baseline, best-value, direction, necessity, causality, or performance meaning to those facts. Use empty arrays when no reliable cells exist. Set needs_visual=true for figures, tables, or damaged/ambiguous equation layout that should be checked against the rendered PDF page. Do not claim visual details that are absent from the supplied text. An empty elements array is valid when the text contains no reliable scientific element.
Write every label, explanation, variable meaning, and finding in the requested language, except mathematical symbols and official figure/table identifiers.

Analyze each supplied target when its target content or supporting chunks contain enough evidence. Preserve the exact object_id, element_type, label, and page supplied for that target. Use only supplied Chunk IDs. Explain every supported variable in an equation. For a figure or table, explain how it should be read and extract supported comparisons or trends. For a table, identify the metric direction, task/dataset scope, baseline, proposed method, and ablation variable before comparing values. Put every numeric best-value, baseline, or ablation comparison in table_checks; absolute_difference must equal target_value - baseline_value. Set label_axis=ROW when baseline/target labels are row labels under one shared metric column, and label_axis=COLUMN when they are column headers on one shared row. Never calculate from missing or truncated cells. A configuration or hyperparameter table supports only directly observed values: put at most five high-confidence numeric cells in table_cell_facts with exact row/column binding, and do not claim a value is required, necessary, causal, better, or best without a controlled comparison. Do not duplicate a comparison check as a cell fact. Use empty arrays when no reliable cells exist. Set needs_visual=true for figures, tables, or damaged equation layout. Do not invent visual details. Omit only a target that truly lacks enough evidence.
Write explanations, meanings, and findings in the requested language, except mathematical symbols and official identifiers.
